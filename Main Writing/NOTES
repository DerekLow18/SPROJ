You mention Hodgkin, Huxley, and Katz, but don't reference any paper by Huxley (only one by Hodgkin and Katz).

p3

Research focused in the neocortex refer to cortical circuits,
a general term for larger neuronal networks located in the cortex and cortical ensembles, referring
to coactive networks of neurons that possibly comprise cortical circuits -- this is potentially the most interesting thought here, and had I seen it before, I'd advised you to expand it. It's too late now, but at the very least know that that's the most interesting part of the whole story, and also an interesting topic to discuss. (I personally am not going to ask you about it, but it sort of prompts to be asked about; it sounds so interesting, and is not quite covered in the text itself)

-----> Personal Note = Keep this in mind in case you don't write about it, be ready to answer questions about it.

p4

Overall, without details, and based only on your explanation, I'm not quite sure how these studies relate to the question of local network connectivity. Based on your description, they sound like generic fMRI studies; maybe looking at redistribution of activation across different areas in development, but there's nothing in this paragraph to suggest that it relates to the topic of your sproj. Do they use similar math? Or do they actually relate their research to local connectivity? That's another question a board member might ask.

p5

The reconstruction
and viewing of networks as compositions of cliques suggests that -- logically dubious. When you try to describe a network as a series of cliques, this approach may work or not. Yet you are writing that the approach itself (essentially, a method) suggsts something about the nature of networks in the brain. This is confusing. The fact that a method works may tell you something about the nature of the network, but I am not qutie sure whether this is what you are trying to say.

p11

I'd say you need a formula for granger causality if you're introducing it.

In brief, the researchers demonstrate -- you don't have any citations here. Once you mention "research", the reader would expect the sentence to end with 2-3 references.

p32

I'm not quite sure what is happening in this figure. Are you comparing inferred degree distributions to the ground truth? Or should I compare a to e, and d to f? How to read it? Please try to clarify the caption if you can.

p33

So the figure seems to suggest that some neurons are connected to all other neurons. That's something a random reader would probably have questions about, so even if you aren't discussing it in the text, it could be prudent to be ready to discuss it at the board. (I won't be asking these questions; I'm too invested, but if I were not your advisor, that would totally be my question)

-----> Personal Note = I'm going to answer this at the board

p35

Mention in the figure caption where these figures came from. Which simulations did you use to produce them? Also the figures are missing axes labels. I also recommend to remind the reader in the caption what words like "Base" and "Activatoin" mean here.

I'm also rather confused why cross-correlation performed as random guessing in your models. It's really cool that you have these curves in your sproj, but that would be another obvious question to ask. Usually x-correlation still gives you a bend above the y=x line; why wan't it a case here?

p36

In the discussion, it would be better to discuss whether your network managed ot reconstruct this degree distribution, whatever it was. Was it close? Was it easy? How did it fare?
