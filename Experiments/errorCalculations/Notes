-The error functions for this were the following:
updatedSteep[weightValueIndex] = round(sigmoidSteepness[weightValueIndex] - learningRate*sigmoidSteep,9)
updatedCenter[weightValueIndex] = round(sigmoidCenter[weightValueIndex] - sigmoidLR*sigmoidShift,9)

-When predicting from a 1 spike to 2 spike, this version does not perform well. It does not attribute the correct end weights, but an inverted read instead.

-this one has the error functions as the following
updatedSteep[weightValueIndex] = round(sigmoidSteepness[weightValueIndex] - learningRate*sigmoidSteep,9)
updatedCenter[weightValueIndex] = round(sigmoidCenter[weightValueIndex] + sigmoidLR*sigmoidShift,9)

-This variant accurately predicts the when going from a 1 spike to a 2 spike step
-Does not perform well going from 1 -> 1
