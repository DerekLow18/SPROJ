My year-long Senior Project at Bard College

## A Brief Summary
In brief, this is my senior project that I spent a year researching and writing.
For those of you unfamiliar with graduation requirements at Bard, Bard requires that
every senior complete a senior project for their respective majors. In my case, I
elected to do a joint major instead of a double major, largely due to the sheer number
of mandatory classes I still had to complete prior to graduation. This meant that I
could complete one senior project that would fulfill the requirements of both the
Biology and Computer Science departments at Bard College.
